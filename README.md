# Ants

## What is this repository about?

In this project, I developed an browser-based game similar to Plants vs. Zombies.
It was a project, as part of the course [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/) at the University of California, Berkeley.
The overarching purpose of the project was to learn about the idea of abstraction.

## How is the repository structured?

- ants.py: The game logic of Ants Vs. SomeBees
- ants_gui.py: The original GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
- graphics.py: Utilities for displaying simple two-dimensional animations
- gui.py: A new GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
- ok: The autograder
- proj3.ok: The ok configuration file
- mytests.rst: Some tests I added
- state.py: Abstraction for gamestate for gui.py
- ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A
- utils.py: Some functions to facilitate the game interface

Folders:
- assets: A directory of images and files used by gui.py
- img: A directory of images used by ants_gui.py
- tests: A directory of tests used by ok
